## limitations
- legend displays only numerical ranges, not text values

## questions 
- load leaflet and JQuery from local library rather than CDN?
- is there a more efficient way to load the largest file (probably GeoJSON) by moving the script.js up and calling it as a function?
- responsive design?
- keyboard tabbing through time with tabindex?
